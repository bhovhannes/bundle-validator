# Contributing

Hi. Thank you for your willingness to improve and extend `@bundle-validator` ecosystem !

Here is everything you need to configure repo on your machine and start making changes.

This is a monorepo, and it uses Yarn and its [Yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) feature.  
You should follow usual Yarn workflow:

1. `git clone` repo
2. Run `yarn`

# Running tests

Run `yarn test` in monorepo root. We use [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/), which means you will see cached output from the last tests run in you have no changes in code.

# Preparing your Pull Request

This repo uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Thus, make sure to include changeset files in your pull request.  
Please go through [Adding a changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) page to understand how to craft a new changeset file.  
This repo has changesets CLI install, so you can use `yarn changeset` to generate a new changeset.

# Publishing a new version

Maintainers are responsible for releases.

That means publish is a multi-step process:

1. Run `yarn changeset version` to generate new versions of packages
2. Review changes generated by `yarn changeset version`
3. Run `yarn changeset publish` to publish packages to NPM

See [Using changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md#using-changesets) for more info.
